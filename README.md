Emacs for Everyday Use
=======
I'm a newbie with Emacs, it's awesome if I can [Learn Emacs in less then Ten Years](http://edward.oconnor.cx/2009/07/learn-emacs-in-ten-years). So, I decided to start from Level One not the Level Zero after read Emacs' tutorial (C-h t). Emacs is the most powerful editor on the world there is no **one of**, it's programmable, elegant and **self-documenting**, so you can start from Level Zero if you had time may be less than 10 years to read and try Emacs.

After falling in love with [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), I know it's the time to make Emacs being a part of my body and mind, not just open a file, navigating, editing, and save it. The Level One of mine start from [this is a Clojure-friendly emacs config](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure), I'd not found [A reasonalbe Emacs config](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) before [this is a Clojure-friendly emacs config](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure). 

So, for everyday use, the adaptive Emacs which I need is more stable, more smaller and more flexible which can be run on anywhere where Emacs can be run. Now, let's start from the Level Two.

## Requirements
* Emacs installation, the version 24+ is more suitable;
* Any keyboard, not mouse;

## Installation
Just one thing you need to do, clone it (just <4MiB) to your HOME directory:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/junjiemars/.emacs.d.git
```
Then start Emacs and wait self-installing packages, if you had an Emacs 24+ 

## Where
* Linux, whatever GUI or Terminal;
* OSX, whatever GUI or Terminal;
* Windows, just GUI

## What
* Lisp, ...
* Emacs can do
