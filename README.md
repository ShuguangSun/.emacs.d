Emacs is a Part of You
=======

It's works on Emacs version 22.1.1 or greater, and on any platform that Emacs
supported, and multiple Emacs instances with different version or different
mode can run on the same machine at the same time.



```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/junjiemars/.emacs.d.git
```


Take your time to have a taste, some features may be you never see it in other 
places. One more thing, it's best to remind you: take care, it's super fast.
