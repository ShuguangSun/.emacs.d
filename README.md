Emacs is a Part of You
=======

[![build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/junjiemars/.emacs.d.svg?branch=master)](https://api.travis-ci.org/junjiemars/.emacs.d)


It's works on Emacs version 22.1.1+ , and on any platform that Emacs supported, and multiple Emacs instances with different version or different mode can run on the same machine at the same time.


```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/junjiemars/.emacs.d.git
```


Take your time to have a taste, some features may be you never see it in other 
places. One more thing, it's best to remind you: take care, it's super fast.
